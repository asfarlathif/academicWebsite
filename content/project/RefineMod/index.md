Developed as a part of the STAT545 course i took, the goal of RefineMod is to provide functions to refine and optimize linear regression models. Models can be refined to only those predictors that are statistically significant in explaining the response variable. Linear regression models can also be compared on the basis of their performance like RMSE, R2 and MAE
