COVID19 Tracker is an interactive shiny application to track the number of cases and deaths due to COVID19 recorded worldwide and in each countries from first date on record to present day. This is also a project I worked on as a part of te STAT545 course. The data is updated daily and is taken  from dataset maintained by Our [World in Data]("https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus").
